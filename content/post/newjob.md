## I got a new job!

I'm very excited to be working as a software developer! I also found a great place to land. Good energy, good people, get things done, and very encouraging towards my development as a programmer.

I'm going to learn a lot about web application architecture in Nodejs and Python. The product also has electronic device components, so I'm excited to learn how the devices and the network connect all together with web back-end and mobile apps.

In the meantime, I'm also planning on continuing my Haskell education. It's just a lot of fun, and provides some amazingly powerful tools for structuring programs. On my shortlist for reading: Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell; Practical Vim; and Concrete Mathematics.

Even while I've been teaching myself to code, it's been difficult to maintain focus and and finish projects. At work, I already feel like it's much easier to buckle down on a program. I think programming for an external purpose will help me just keep going and practice more. And that will help keep me disciplined and motivated for my own more "fun" projects.

I really feel like I'm moving forward! I can't wait to see where this job will take me!

(also, just to insert a piece of code in here:

Why does ``` replicateM 2 [1, 3] ``` give the output it does?)
